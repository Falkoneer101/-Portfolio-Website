            <hr><b><u><li>Chevrolet Corvette</b></u><br>
                With supercar performance, an affordable price tag, and flashy styling, the 2023 Chevrolet Corvette honors the 
                nameplate's decades-old status as an automotive icon—but with a mid-engine twist. The current C8 is the first 
                generation to have its naturally aspirated V-8 engine mounted behind the passenger compartment, which boosts 
                Chevy's halo sports car into the realm of exotic machinery. Its sharp handling and explosive acceleration are a 
                match for sports cars costing tens of thousands more, but it's also comfortable and refined enough to drive 
                cross-country. The C8 is offered as both a convertible and a coupe, and the hardtop model has a roof panel that 
                can be lifted off to allow the sun to shine in. Its cabin is cozy but comfortable, and there's adequate trunk 
                storage for groceries or luggage, making the Corvette an easy sports car to live with on a daily basis.<hr></li>
            <hr><li><b><u>Ford Mustang</u></b><br>
                For more than 55 years, the Ford Mustang has continued to evolve into a more sophisticated steed. This iteration 
                comes standard with a 310-hp turbocharged inline-four EcoBoost engine with a six-speed manual transmission. 
                And while the pony car gets as wild as the 760-hp Shelby GT500, reviewed separately, the more conventional choice 
                is the Mustang GT with the 450-hp V-8 engine. Both the four-cylinder and V-8 can be mated to a manual transmission 
                or a 10-speed automatic. Mustangs are offered either as a hard-shell coupe or rag-top convertible, but every 
                Mustang powers the rear wheels. Although a High Performance 330-hp EcoBoost is an available upgrade for the 
                four-cylinder, the Mustang is best served with the growling V-8. While its closest muscular rival, the Chevy Camaro, 
                has a more ergonomic interior, the Mustang's larger back seat and better outward visibility make it easier to live with.<hr></li>
            <hr><li><b><u>Porsche 718 Cayman</u></b><br>
                When it comes to sports cars, we're easily charmed, but certain cars still linger in our minds for being truly 
                outstanding. The 2023 Porsche 718 Cayman is one such sports car that continues to captivate our collective 
                attention—and one that we're happy to have on our 2023 10Best cars list. Its turbocharged engines are mounted 
                amidships, giving the Cayman—and its convertible sibling, the 718 Boxster—a natural handling advantage over 
                front-engined rivals such as the Jaguar F-Type and the Toyota Supra. On a twisty road, the Cayman is unflappable, 
                and its crisp handling makes you never want to stop driving. Sure, there are too few places to stash your phone, 
                keys, and beverages inside the two-seat cabin, and the base turbo four could sound a bit more refined. Otherwise, 
                the Cayman is an impeccably engineered sports car that's easy to love. We should know. We've fallen head over heels 
                for our long-term 718 Cayman GTS 4.0, which has impressed us in all the ways expected—and even some unexpected, 
                including how few compromises it requires to drive daily.<hr></li>
            <hr><li><b><u>Toyota GR Supra</u></b><br>
                Toyota's halo sports car, the 2023 GR Supra, delivers enough excitement, style, and drama to make up for the 
                brand's more sedate sedans, hatchbacks, and SUVs. Developed and built alongside the BMW Z4 convertible, the GR 
                Supra offers similar build quality and simpler—but still handsome—interior materials inside. The entry-level 
                255-hp turbocharged four-cylinder provides ample power, but we can't help but adore the ferocious, optional 382-hp 
                turbocharged 3.0-liter BMW inline-six that makes this two-seater fly. Rear-wheel drive is the only setup, and 
                the GR Supra's sure-footed chassis and sharp steering enable it to come alive on twisty roads and race courses. 
                Sure, it may borrow a little too heavily from the BMW parts bin for some Toyota fanboys, and its sweptback 
                exterior design creates some awfully large blind spots, but even so, the GR Supra remains one of our favorite 
                sports cars.</li><hr>
