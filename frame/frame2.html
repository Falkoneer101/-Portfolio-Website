<H1><u><i>Mazda Savanna RX-7</i></u></H1>
<p>Today the RX-7 is a rare beast, especially one that has been untouched by the greasy fingers of backyard tuners. 
    There is a caveat with the RX-7 though, as with all rotary-engined Mazda’s, the RX-7’s highly-strung engine not 
    only requires lots of TLC to remain healthy, but also cyclical engine rebuilds thanks to the deterioration of rotor 
    seals. The original RX-7 was launched in 1978 – its light, compact fastback style and rotary engines proved a hit 
    among buyers.</p>
