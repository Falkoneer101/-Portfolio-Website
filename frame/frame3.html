<H1><u><i>1998 MK4 Toyota Supra</i></u></H1>
<p>Known as the 2JZ-GTE, this formidable contender has been swapped into almost every make and model. This Toyota 
    Supra engine is rated at 321 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque, but we sill dissect that a little later. This 
    allowed the MK4 Supra top speed to be 177 mph, but it was limited to 155 mph outside of Japan. The efficiency 
    of sequential turbochargers allows the Mark 4 Supra to run 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds. At the drag strip, a 
    Toyota Supra 1/4 mile of 13 seconds at 109 mph made it quicker than many V8 competitors.</p>
