                        <h3><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Volleyball, game played by two teams, usually of six players on a side,
                            in which the players use their hands to bat a ball back and forth
                            over a high net, trying to make the ball touch the court within the opponents
                            playing area before it can be returned. To prevent this a player on the opposing
                            team bats the ball up and toward a teammate before it touches the court surface—
                            that teammate may then volley it back across the net or bat it to a third teammate  
                            who volleys it across the net. A team is allowed only three touches of the ball before 
                            it must be returned over the net.</span></h3>

                            ball through the opponents goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket. It was 
                            invented by Dr. James Naismith on December 01, 1891, at the International Young Mens Christian Association (YMCA) Training 
                            School (now Springfield College), Springfield, Massachusetts, where Naismith was an instructor in physical education.</span></h3></div>
