    <h1><u><i>Social Media</i></u></h1>
    <P>Social media has taken over the business sphere, the advertising sphere and additionally, the education sector. 
        <BR>It has had a long-lasting impact on the way people communicate and has now become an integral part of their lives. 
        <BR>For instance, WhatsApp has redefined the culture of IMs (instant messaging) and taken it to a whole new level. 
        <BR>Today, you can text anyone across the globe as long as you have an internet connection. 
        <BR>This transformation has not only been brought about by WhatsApp but also Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram. 
        <br>The importance of social media in communication is a constant topic of discussion.
        <br>Online communication has brought information to people and audiences that previously could not be reached. 
        <br>It has increased awareness among people about what is happening in other parts of the world. 
        <br>A perfect example of the social media’s reach can be seen in the way the story about the Amazon Rainforest fire spread. 
        <br>It started with a single post and was soon present on everyone’s newsfeed across different social media platforms.</P>
