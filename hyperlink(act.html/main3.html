    <P>Watching movies could be motivational in many ways. Giving your mind a break from work for something enjoyable could motivate you to <br>be more productive when you get back to it and to ward off feelings of burnout. If the movie highlights someone successfully
    <br>chasing their ambitions, it could motivate you to do the same. It might also inspire you to take up a new hobby or pursue a new goal,
    <br>If you’ve been feeling some level of disconnect between someone close to you — whether it’s your romantic partner, best friend, or <br>child — watching movies together could be just the ticket to rekindle your relationship. It could be especially helpful if you have <br>the same taste in movies and choose something new that you’re both enthused about watching. Not only will you bond in the moment of <br>watching, but you might feel a renewed sense of connection when you discuss what you watched afterward.A good comedy could help <br>lower your stress levels. A 2016 study found that laughter could reduce the levels of hormones in the body responsible for stress, <br>such as cortisol and epinephrine. If you live with an anxiety disorder or depression, or you’re simply anxious and stressed about <br>work and family commitments, taking time to watch a movie could help improve your mood.</p>
